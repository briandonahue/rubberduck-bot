+ I'm stuck
- What are you stuck on?
+ * not working *
- What debugging have you done?
- Have you tried turning it off and on again?
+ What should I fix next?
- Have you looked through the high or medium priority issues in Github?
- Have you used the site recently from your phone? There are probably visual defects you'll notice.
